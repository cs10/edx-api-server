# edx-api-server `lib/`

## TODO....

This will (eventually) contain the code for each edX endpoint designed by edX service.

* `edx/` covers tools in the default LMS for learners / staff
* `studio/` covers tools that need to be accessed through the studio authoring interface.
* `insights/` covers tools that access the Insights data dashboards.

Note that some of the tasks (like checking enrollment...) can be done in more than one UI. The code belongs in the folder of the tool that is being scraped.
